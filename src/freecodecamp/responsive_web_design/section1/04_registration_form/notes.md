The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is relative to 1% of the height
of the viewport.

It is time to spruce the project up with some CSS. Begin by giving the body
a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh. body { width : 100%; height: 100vh;
}

Step 12

The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified
in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL
parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request
body (with method="post").

Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request.
<form action='https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org' method='post'></form>

Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select
element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option
element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require
closing tags.

Start by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then nest 5
option elements within the select element.
<select>
<option></option>
<option></option>
<option></option>
<option></option>
<option></option>
</select>
